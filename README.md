This design captures:
--Multiple movies showing in a theatre
--Different show timings for each movie
--Multiple screens in a theatre
--Seat management for each show
--Different pricing for different seat categories
--Show date and time management
--Movie details including language and certification

Additional considerations:
--We might want to add tables for booking management
--User management would be needed for actual ticket booking
--Payment related tables would be required
--Tables for offers and promotions could be added
--Movie ratings and reviews could be separate entities

This schema follows normalization rules:
1NF: All tables have primary keys
No repeating groups
All attributes contain atomic values

2NF: Satisfies 1NF
All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key

3NF: Satisfies 2NF
No transitive dependencies
Each non-key attribute depends only on the primary key

BCNF: Satisfies 3NF
For each functional dependency X â†’ Y, X is a super key

Key features:
--Used appropriate data types and constraints
--Implemented foreign key relationships
--Added timestamps for auditing
--Used ENUM for fixed value fields
--Created unique constraints where needed
--Added sample data matching the screenshot
--The schema allows for:
--Multiple shows per movie
--Different pricing per show and seat category
--Tracking seat availability
--Multiple screens per theatre
--Different screen types and formats
